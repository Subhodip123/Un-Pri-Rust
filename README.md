# Un-Pri-Rust

This repo is a collection of papers regarding **Un**certainty and **Pri**vacy aware **R**ob**ust** Deep Learning Models which are published in many peer reviewed conferences and jounals. These are collected as I read the papers on daily basis. In each table the papers are sorted in such a way that initial papers give you an overview on the topic and the latters give you a more deeper understanding to specific problems.
